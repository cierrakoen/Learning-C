# Learning-C
Below I have various C files that I created within my System Level Programming Class!
1) Try.c : This program opens a file and tests to see if there is text within it.
2) calcPrice: Lets the user enter price, quantity, and date and converts the answer into a final price.
3) getPhoneNumber.c : lets the user enter a phone number in the form (999)999-9999 and then makes the string to equal the phone number format 999-999-9999.
4) avgWordLength.c : The user enters a sentence and the average of the word length is returned.
5) revNum.c : reverses the number 1125 to 5211.
6) findStr.c : Lets a user enter as many words as they want until a 4 letter word is chosen. After that the shortest and longest words are printed.
7) myStringCopy.c : My own execution of the strcpy() which copies a string char for char until a white space is provided.
8) splitTime.c : The program lets a user enter the number of seconds of their choice and converts it to hours, minutes, and seconds.
9) swapAlpha.c : This program takes two users strings and switches the first strings numbers with the second strings letters.
10) checkPasswd.c : Asks the user to make a password. If the user's password is under 10 characters 5 points are reduced for every character. If the user's password doesn't contain a capital letter, a lowercase letter, and a number then 20 points is deducted. If the user has more than 2 consecutive letters or numbers that are the same then 20 points will also be deducted. If the user's points are 30 or more the user will be asked to try again.
11) help.sh & helpme.sh: The help.sh file is a text file that has 10 bash commands while the helpme.sh file lets a user find out what one of the 10 commands do in bash.
12) aod_num.c : Asks the user weather they want to sort a predetermined number list either by ascending or descending the list.
13) calculator.sh : The bash file lets a user enter two numbers that can be multiplied, divided, subtracted, added, and modulus from one another.
14) phonebook.sh and phonebook.txt : Phonebook.sh lets the user add a persons name and ties it to their phone number which the user also enters. The data is stored within phonebook.txt and the user can even changethe contact name.
