# Learning-C
Below I have various C files that I created within my System Level Programming Class!
1) Try.c : This program opens a file and tests to see if there is text within it.
2) calcPrice: Lets the user enter price, quantity, and date and converts the answer into a final price.
3) getPhoneNumber.c : lets the user enter a phone number in the form (999)999-9999 and then makes the string to equal the phone number format 999-999-9999.
4) avgWordLength.c : The user enters a sentence and the average of the word length is returned.
5) revNum.c : reverses the number 1125 to 5211.
6) findStr.c : Lets a user enter as many words as they want until a 4 letter word is chosen. After that the shortest and longest words are printed.
7) myStringCopy.c : My own execution of the strcpy() which copies a string char for char until a white space is provided.
8) splitTime.c : The program lets a user enter the number of seconds of their choice and converts it to hours, minutes, and seconds.
9) swapAlpha.c : This program takes two users strings and switches the first strings numbers with the second strings letters.
